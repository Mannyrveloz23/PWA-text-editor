# Homework README - Text Editor PWA

## Description

This project is about exploring the completed J.A.T.E application, which is a Progressive Web Application (PWA), to gain a deeper understanding of how a PWA is properly configured in a web application. The goal is to record a video between 90-seconds to 2-minutes in length of the J.A.T.E application, explaining the key components that comprise its PWA.

## Installation

To install and run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. In the project directory, run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to create an optimized build of the application.
4. The build will be generated in the `dist` folder. You can serve the build using any web server of your choice.
5. Now you can use a development server by running `npm start dev`.

## Usage

The J.A.T.E application is a text editor that has been developed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). It allows users to enter and save text content, which is stored in an IndexedDB database. The application also uses Workbox to register a service worker, which improves performance by caching assets and allowing the application to work offline.
